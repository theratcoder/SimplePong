## SimplePong

A simple pong game that you are welcome to play, work on, and have fun with this project!

### Running the precomplied exe

Just double-click and run it like anything else.

#### Controls

- A to raise the left paddle, D to lower it
- left arrow to raise the right paddle, right to lower it

You can change all of these bindings yourself pretty easily.

### Compiling it for yourself

It doesn't require anything special, just Visual Studio (not VS Code!) with the C++ Win32 support packages installed.
Make sure you are using Windows, as it won't work on MacOS or Linux.
